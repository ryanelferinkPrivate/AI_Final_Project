# Hide_and_Seek

Hi all, this is my first experience using GitHub with Unity as well so we may run into some issues as we go.

This is how you should push to the repo after making changes in Unity (though I have not tested this with anyone yet)
git add Assets ProjectSettings Packages    <-- NOTE. Make sure you use this format and not git add . as we don't want every file
git commit -m "Describe what changed (e.g. updated enemy AI, new scene)"
git push origin main


If you run into any issues, let me know
- Ethan
